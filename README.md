# Pathfinding Visualizer

See final product here: https://optimistic-raman-659e60.netlify.app/.

This project is a visualizer for several common pathfinding algorithms, including Breadth First Search, Depth First Search and the A* Search Algorithm. Simply input a start and end location, as well as some obstacles on the provided grid, and watch the steps that the respective algorithms take to find a path to the destination!
